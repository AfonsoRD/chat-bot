# Chat App

## Project description

A Chat App for mobile devices using React Native. The app will provide users with a chat interface and options to share images and their location.

### Key Features

- A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen
  before joining the chat.

- A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
- The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images
  and location data.
- Data gets stored online and offline.

### User Stories

- As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my friends and family
- As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange
  the latest news.
- As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.
- As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
- As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any time.
- As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.
